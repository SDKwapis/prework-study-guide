# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was designed to build a page where I could refence all of my study materials going into the 6 month MSU Coding Bootcamp program. It was also a space where I could test the skills I learned completeing the prework modules. Those skills include HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. 

It gives me a space where I can record new notes, review links to documents and other helpful information, and try out new coding skills I learn along the way.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Scroll through the page to read infromation relating to HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.

A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics I learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

Hyperlinked text will be underlined. Click it to learn more about that particular topic. ![alt text](assets/images/hyperlink.png)
